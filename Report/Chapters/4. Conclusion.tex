\section{Conclusion}
Given the input signal, the circuit designed is able to measure the force applied to the foot; however, It's not for real-world application, the walking frequency is not exactly 1 Hz, and the maximum force applied to the sensor is not exactly 1000 N-people can apply more force on one foot than the other- and the urban electric noise amplitude is not exactly 0.1 V. \\
But for the purpose of this project, the circuit is able to measure the force applied to the foot. The output of the circuit is almost sum of the voltage generated by the piezoelectric attached to the front of the foot and the piezoelectric attached to the back of the foot. For real-world application, the circuit should be tested with real data and the parameters of the circuit should be adjusted to fit the real-world application.\\
